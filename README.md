The program runs a readability test using traits that are characteristic of higher reading levels.

Longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too. A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years, to give a formulaic process for computing the reading level of a text.

The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.) grade level is needed to understand the text.

The formula is:

index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8

Where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

The user can input a text to know its reading level.
